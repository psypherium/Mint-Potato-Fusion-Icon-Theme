this will be a fork of the "mint-relaxed" icon theme.

the only change that I have planned so far is to change the window controls from triangle-triangle-cross to centeredline-box-cross.

If I am successful with the above, I might do some other stuff.

i might also refork this into a "dont theme our apps" version, which only changes the folder icon and leaves everything else unaltered/gnome-stock.

### ðŸ–¼ Description

**Mint-Relaxed-Icons** is a modern, unified icon set designed to complement the [Mint-Relaxed GTK theme](https://www.pling.com/p/2302153/).
It aims to deliver a clean and visually consistent desktop experience for Linux Mint Cinnamon users â€” but it works well with other GTK-based desktops too.

The set includes redesigned system icons, updated application icons, and custom folder styles to enhance clarity and harmony across the system.

It is partially based on open source icon themes licensed under the GPL, such as:

* **Breeze** â€“ many icons were used as-is or modified
* **Numix-Circle** â€“ used occasionally for some application icons
* **Papirus** â€“ used in very small parts (e.g., one or two icons)
* **Hicolor** â€“ one or two icons included from this fallback theme

I also drew inspiration from a Breeze-based icon theme called Relax, which has a beautiful folder design. Unfortunately, that theme was missing many icons for Cinnamon and GNOME-based desktops. Therefore, I:

* Redesigned many outdated icons to match the modern aesthetic
* Created many icons from scratch
* Carefully curated and unified the look to match the Cinnamon environment
